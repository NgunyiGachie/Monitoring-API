project:
  name: Renewable Energy Monitoring API
  description: |
    An API to track and monitor renewable energy production and consumption from various sources (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines)
    It provides real-time metrics, tracks carbon offsets, and forecasts energy production based on weather data.
  features:
    - Data Submission:
        description: |
          Simulates data from IoT devices such as solar panels and wind turbines.
        simulated data:
          - device_id: Unique identifier for each device.
          - timestamp: Timestamp of each submission.
          - energy_produced_kwh: Energy produced in kilowatt-hours.
    -Real-Time Metrics:
        description: |
          Provides real-time insights into energy production and consumption.
        metrics:
          - total_energy_produced: Total energy generated over time.
          - total_energy_consumed: Total energy consumed.
          - net_energy_balance: Energy surplus (production - consumption).
    - Carbon Offset Tracking:
        description: |
          Calculates the CO2 emissions avoided using renewable energy.
        calculations:
          -conversion_factor: Amount of CO2 offset per kWh (e.g/, 0.85 kg CO2/kwh for solar energy)
          - cumulative_offset: Total offset over time.
    - Forecasting Energy Production:
        description: |
          Uses weather data to predict energy production for solar panels and wind turbines.
        integrations:
          - weather_api: Fetches real-time and forecasted weather data.
          - solar_factors: Sunlight hours, cloud cover.
          - wind_factors: Wind speed, air density
    - User Interaction:
        description: |
        Provides endpoints for users to:
          - view production/consumption metrics.
          - Track carbon offsets.
          - Get energy forecasts.
        example_endpoints:
        - /metrics
        - /forecast: Predicts energy production for upcoming days.
    - Data Simulation:
        description: |
          Simulates IoT devices and energy data streams for testing.
        simulation_logic:
